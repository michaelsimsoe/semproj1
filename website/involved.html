      <h3>Support</h3>
      <p>
        There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important way we keep this
        museum open and accessible to the whole community.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum’s collections. If you have some item or collection

      <h3>Volunteer</h3>
      <p>
        A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors to come
        and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working museum, access to
        staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to discuss ideas for future
        exhibits and strategies for the museum.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us if you’d like to find out more about how you
        can get involved.
